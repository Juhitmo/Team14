/**
 * TODO
 * 
 * For next release
 * ----------------
 * - Clean up render(), break logical chunks into their own methods 
 * - Clean up or eliminate Razorback.java, turns out we might not need it
 * - Splash, high score, and instruction screens
 * - To do high score screen, we need a scoring mechanism
 * - Implement dash timer
 * - We have jump, now need double jump
 * - Implement sprite animation,
 *   	tutorial: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/SpriteAnimation
 * 
 * To implement soon-ish
 * ---------------------
 * - New test map with platforms and gaps to test for losing a life at bottom
 * - Add overlaid killable objects where collidable tiles are, or change
 *   	collision detection for vertical surfaces to notify of life lost?
 *
 *   ... OR OR OR ...
 *   
 * - Detect forward velocity on render. If we go slower than the original
 *   	velocity (or dash velocity in dash mode), we die.
 *      I don't know why I didn't think of this before.
 *
 * - Create class and sprite for breakable object
 * - If we do premapped levels instead of a neverending random level, 
 * 		determine when we reach end of level for victory. 
 * - Tests tests tests tests tests tests
 * 
 * Completed
 * ---------
 * - Fix so camera doesn't change frame of reference, ie razorback appears to
 *		stay in same x coordinate 
 * 
 * Eventually...
 * -------------
 * - Music + sound effects
 * - Create a decent level map, at least 1000 tiles long?
